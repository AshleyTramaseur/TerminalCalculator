# TerminalCalculator
Calculator that runs in terminal emulator / command prompt 
Move the 'TerminalCalc' file into the /bin directory 

#this is where bash files are stored and allow them to be executed from anywhere 

Move the 'calculator.py' file to the first directory or change the execute path in the 'TerminalCalc' file to where 'calculator.py' is saved

#this is so that 'TerminalCalc' knows where to find 'caclulator.py' to execute it
